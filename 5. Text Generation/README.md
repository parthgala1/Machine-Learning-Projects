> Don't forget to install all the dependencies in the project.

In this project using the `GPT2` model from `huggingface`, we learnt how to generate text and tune other paramters to understand how training of the model and generation of the text works. By providing a simple sentence, it was able to produce new text about the lines `The Fun and Games of College Tours`. 

It also covered the `NLTK` library topcis and the Natural Language Processing of AI. Follow this [Link](https://github.com/parthgala1/NLP) to know more about `NLP`.
