This is a twitter sentiment analysis where machine learns to filter out negative and postive tweets using logistic regression. To train on the tweets `NLTK` laibrary was used for Natural Language Processing. The dataset contained 1.6M tweets collected from twitter API and using EDA, I then trained the model on it.
